# Cache Simulator

In this assignment, you will implement a cache simulator for a memory system with a level-1 read-only instruction cache, a level-1 data cache, and a unified level-2 cache. The latter two should support both reads and writes.

The pre-code provides a CPU simulator that will perform memory access against your memory subsystem. Your goal is to use the simulator to find the best cache design for your benchmark from mandatory assignment 1 (or another benchmark). To do this, you will measure the cache hit and miss ratios and experiment with different caches' parameters.

## Cache specifications

Some specifications for the cache are fixed:
As a starting point, you should use the following specifications:

- The CPU – L1 bus width is 256 bits.
- The L1 – L2 bus width is the L1 line size
- The L2 – RAM bus width is the L2 line size.

Additionally, the table below suggests initial parameters for each of the caches. Note that your design should make it easy to change the different parameters. Also note that you need to take into account the dataset size. For example, if you have a dataset that is 4 KB, a L1 data cache size of 32 KB is not realistic.

|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Cache size          | 32 KB                | 32 KB               | 512 KB              |
| Cache associativity | 4-way associativity  | 8-way associativity | 8-way associativity |
| Inclusive policy    |       N/A            |       N/A           | Inclusive
| Replacement policy  | Approximated LRU     | Approximated LRU    | Approximated LRU    |
| Line size           | 64 bytes             | 64 bytes            | 64 bytes            |
| Bus width           | 32 bytes             | 32 bytes            | 32 bytes            |
| Write policy        | Write-back           | Write-back          | Write-back          |


## Cache simulator implementation

As a starting point for your simulator implementation, we provide a pre-code that implements the API of a memory subsystem and a CPU using this API. The simulator executes instruction fetch, data load, and data store memory operations based on a given memory trace file. The trace is stored in a binary format specified by the _p2AddrTr_ structure in the _byurt.h_ header file. You are required to write an implementation of a memory hierarchy over the memory subsystem API containing modules for the caches. It is not necessary to make any changes to the pre-code, except _memory.c_, which is your starting point.

Your cache design and implementation should satisfy the following requirements:

1. The caches should be possible to implement in real hardware; that is, the cache parameters must be realistic according to your textbook.
2. Cache parameters such as size, line size, write-back policy, and associativity should be easily changeable, either as runtime arguments or using compile-time flags (defines).
3. The L1 data cache and L2 caches should support both reads and writes, and the L1 instruction cache must be read-only (you may want to use a generic cache implementation that you can use for all three caches, so you don't need to enforce a mechanism for preventing writes to the L1 instruction cache instance, but make sure you never write to it).
4. The caches should support the parameters and policies specified above. Also, the caches should support the parameters and policies specified in the evaluation section below.

### Simplifications

1. You can assume that each data access is within the boundary of a cache line.
2. For simulating instruction fetch, you can assume that all instructions are of a fixed size and that the addresses are word-aligned (note that the IA-instructions have variable length and may not be word-aligned, so effectively you may ignore the last two bits of the accessed memory addresses to pretend that accesses are aligned).
3. You do not have to implement reads and writes that actually transfer data. Just count cache hits and misses.

## Methodology

You will evaluate the cache by creating a memory access trace that contains all the memory accesses of a program. You should create at least two traces:

1. A trace used to test the correctness of the simulator. For this trace, you should know in advance the number of cache hits and misses the trace is going to produce, given a set of cache parameters.
2. A trace of memory addresses collected for your benchmark from assignment 1 (or another benchmark). You will use this to evaluate the cache parameters to find the best cache design for your benchmark.
    
The correctness trace may need to be created manually be starting from a known cache state and then adding one-by-one memory operations to the trace.

To create a trace file for your benchmark, you must first produce a log file over memory accesses. You will then convert the log file to binary trace format by using the _traceconverter.py_ script from the pre-code. To produce the log file, you can either use a memory tracing tool such as Valgrind/ lackey or by analyzing your program to find the memory access pattern and then create a trace that reflects this (for example, by writing a script that creates the log file). 

To run valgrind on your benchmark, you may execute the following command:

_valgrind --log-file=logfile --tool=lackey --trace-mem=yes [program-name]_

Valgrind will produce a file _logfile_ that may be used as input to the _traceconverter.py_ script to create a binary trace file _trace.tr_. 

You can then run the cache simulator with the trace file as input: _./cachesim trace.rt_

The pre-code will initialize your memory subsystem by calling *memory_init()* and then, for each memory access in _trace.rt_, call one of the functions:
* *memory_fetch()* - if the memory access is an instruction fetch
* *memory_read()* - if the memory access is a data read
* *memory_write()* - if the memory access is a data write

You should make sure that the dataset size used to create the trace is realistic. In case it is not practical to create a memory trace for a realistic dataset, due to time or storage size constraints, you need to discuss in your report how the reduced size influences the measured results.

## Evaluation

Your goal is to find the cache configuration that gives your benchmark the best performance at the lowest hardware implementation cost. To do this, you will start with the default parameters listed in the _Cache specifications_-section. Then you should change one parameter at a time and measure the changes in hit and miss ratio for each cache. The parameters you will change for each cache are:
* Total cache size
* Line size
* Associativity
* Write-policy (write-back, write-through)

You should also select a replacement policy and implement it:
* Random
* LRU
* Temporal/Spatial

When counting cache hits and misses, you should differentiate between:
* Layers
* Reads
* Writes

You are also allowed to change additional parameters. Note that the number of sets in a given cache is a dependent variable given from the total cache size, line size, and associativity (number of ways = number of lines per set). 

Your report should present the results from your measurements and provide a discussion about the cost of implementing your final cache design in hardware.

## Deliverables

This is a group assignment. You should submit:
* Code
* Traces
* Results for your measurments
* A written report, maximum of six pages long including everything

The report's goal is to convince a computer architecture expert that your cache design is the best for your particular benchmark. You should assume that the expert may want to repeat your experiments to verify your results. *You therefore do not need to explain how caches work, or other basic concepts described in the textbook*. The report should contain all the information required to redo your work, including the following parts:

1. Your names, emails, GitHub usernames, and your GitHub repository
2. Introduction: where you describe your benchmark, its realistic input data, and its memory access pattern. 
3. Methodology: where you describe how to do the experiments, including:
    * Cache simulator implementation and design: where you provide the details for the expert to re-implement your cache simulator.
    * How you count cache hits and misses for each cache.
    * The design of your correctness test trace, including how to use them to test for correctness
4. Results: where you present the evaluation results.
5. Discussion: where you discuss the most interesting result with respect to hardware cost.
6. Conclusion: where you write a summary of the best cache design. 

The delivered code repository must contain:
* A directory named _doc_, containing the report, and your measurement results in a human readable format
* A direcroty named _data_, containing your traces.
* A directory named _src_, containing code, Makefiles, README
  * No compiled files! Delete executables, etc. before you hand in the assignment
  * README must contain how to compile and run the code
 * A file named after your UiT username

Submit using git.

## Grading

The assignment grade (pass / not pass) is based mainly on your report.
